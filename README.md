Its using gin and possibly swagger after the fact. Right now I'm just trying to get comfortable with gin and I was at a go con the other day where there were 3 talks that mentined swagger. Also I'm looking for an excuse to use htmx or unpoly so this might be it



todo:

[x] get cards to render
[x] detail view route
[x] click event attached to cards
[x] on click it opens detail view
[x] gets tasks to render
[x] add routing for a show view for a task - i think unpoly's layers can be used for this
[x] make a seed to create some tasks in each column and get it to render properly
[] make detail view look pretty
[] add a create card button/form
[] add a create task button/form
[] add a complete task button/form
[] make dragging to different columns update the column in the model
[] add a route to update the card data
