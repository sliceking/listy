Its using gin and possibly swagger after the fact. Right now I'm just trying to get comfortable with gin and I was at a go con the other day where there were 3 talks that mentined swagger. Also I'm looking for an excuse to use htmx or unpoly so this might be it



todo:

[] add columns table
[] add column assoc to task
[] add routing for a show view for a task - i think unpoly's layers can be used for this
[] make a seed to create some tasks in each column and get it to render properly
